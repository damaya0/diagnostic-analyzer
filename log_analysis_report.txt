Analysis Results:
The logs show repeated invocation of the HealthcareAPI with the message "Welcome to HealthcareService," which indicates that the API is operational. One error occurs at 14:42:06,820 when the system fails to parse a JSON payload. The error message "Illegal character: <d>" suggests that the payload being sent does not conform to the expected JSON format. The stack trace points to issues in the JSON-to-XML conversion process during payload transformation. The error appears to be triggered within the PayloadFactoryMediator, which is attempting to create a new JSON payload. The exception originates from the JSON parsing components in the StAXON library. The timing of the error is well isolated among several successful log entries, which suggests that the error only occurs when a malformed payload is sent to the endpoint.
