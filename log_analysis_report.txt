Analysis of the logs reveals that the API is repeatedly logging a welcome message before encountering an error during payload processing.  
The error occurs when attempting to parse a payload, indicating that the JSON parser is receiving an unexpected character ("<d>") which is likely due to an incorrect or malformed payload format.  
The exception stack trace shows that the error is thrown from within the JSON to XML conversion process.  
The error stack specifically highlights issues in the JsonScanner class as well as subsequent JSON processing classes.  
Repeated log messages suggest that the API is correctly receiving requests; however, the payload transformation using the PayloadFactoryMediator is failing due to invalid input.  
The error appears to be triggered during the processing inside the org.apache.synapse.commons.staxon.core.json and org.apache.synapse.commons.json packages.  
This indicates that further investigation should focus on how the payload is being received, transformed, and the type of data sent to the endpoint.
