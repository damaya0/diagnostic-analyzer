Analysis Summary:
The logs show repeated successful invocations of the HealthcareAPI endpoint returning the welcome message.
An error occurs when processing the payload in the micro integrator. The error stack trace indicates that the JSON transformation process is failing due to an illegal character, specifically "<d>".
The error begins with an inability to obtain a parser from the data source for an element named jsonObject. This suggests that there is an issue with how the payload is formatted or with its conversion from JSON to XML.
The stack trace points to failures in the JSON utility components, including JSON stream parsing and payload factory mediation. The PayloadFactoryMediator appears to be trying to construct a new JSON payload but is encountering invalid characters.
The timing of events is typical with multiple log entries before and after the error, suggesting intermittent invocation triggering the failure. No other components are showing chronic failure besides those handling the payload transformation.
