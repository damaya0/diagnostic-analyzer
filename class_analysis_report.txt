Below is the detailed analysis and recommendations based on the review of the JsonUtil class files.

Design Flaws and Code Smells:
• The class is a massive utility with many responsibilities (JSON–XML conversion, stream handling, OMElement manipulation, configuration of factories, etc.). This “God‐class” design makes it harder to maintain and test.
• The configuration for JSON/ XML conversion is read from properties in static initializers. While this caches configuration on startup, changes at runtime cannot be applied. It would be preferable to encapsulate configuration in a dedicated component.
• The method removeIndentations shows commented code (line 662). The statement “children = elem.getChildren();” is commented out while a try–catch block exists for that operation. This may hide issues when traversing the OMElement tree and could be causing unexpected behavior if the element’s children are not retrieved.
• The use of context properties to store input streams (for example, using setJsonStream and storing the stream in the message context) tightly couples the processing logic to the MessageContext. Consider wrapping the JSON payload and its metadata into a dedicated object.
• The JSON payload type determination based on the first character (such as checking if the content starts with “{”, “[”, a digit, etc.) is brittle. If the incoming payload has extra spaces, control characters, or encoding issues it can lead to mis-detection and possibly produce errors when later processed.

Error Handling Issues:
• Several catch blocks catch exceptions (XMLStreamException, IOException) and log the error before wrapping and throwing AxisFault. In some places (for example, removeIndentations) errors are caught but just logged (or the loop returns) without any recovery or clean-up, possibly leaving the element in a partially transformed state.
• In methods such as writeJsonStream, if the stream reset fails then the error is logged and a null value may be returned. In high-load systems this could lead to intermittent failures.
• The error message “Illegal character: <d>” may be due to an underlying XMLStreamReader issue when parsing JSON content that contains unexpected tokens—the code that builds the XMLStreamReader sometimes uses a delegate. If the underlying JSON payload has invalid characters, the exception is caught but the error is only logged with a localized message. More detailed error reporting and possibly validation before processing would help.

Resource Management Problems:
• Many methods transform input streams into byte arrays (for example, IOUtils.copy and then new ByteArrayInputStream) without a clear use of try–with–resources. Although some streams are closed via IOUtils.closeQuietly, it is not consistently applied.
• The ReadOnlyBIS inner class overrides close() to perform a reset rather than true stream closing. This design may lead to multiple consumers reading from the same buffered stream concurrently. It is unclear if this stream is thread safe.
• The stream handling in writeJsonStream resets the stream only if markSupported() returns true. In cases where mark/reset is not supported or fails, the JSON stream cannot be re-read by downstream components.

Threading or Concurrency Issues:
• The use of static factory instances (jsonOutputFactory, jsonInputFactory, xmlInputFactoryNoPIs) implies that these objects are shared across threads. Although they appear to be used in a read-only mode, it should be confirmed that their internal state is thread safe.
• MessageContext properties are being used to store and later read JSON streams. If the MessageContext is accessed concurrently without proper isolation, there is a risk of race conditions or unexpected behavior.
• The ReadOnlyBIS class does not allow marking or skipping. Since the same stream is reused across different consumers (via caching methods like cachedCopyOfJsonPayload) concurrent access can lead to corruption of stream state if not synchronized.

Other Code Smells or Anti–Patterns:
• Many methods replicate logic (for instance, multiple overloads of newJsonPayload, getNewJsonPayload for different input types, etc.). This duplication increases the maintenance burden.
• The method newJavaScriptSourceReader adds parentheses around the payload manually, assuming that the consumer needs a JavaScript-source–wrapped JSON. It would be clearer to separate this wrapper logic from the core JSON conversion.
• The reuse of an InputStream stored in a MessageContext property (for example, in jsonStream and its copies) may lead to unexpected behavior if the same stream is read multiple times without proper cloning.
• In various places the code uses logging at debug or trace level to output sensitive state (for example, complete element content). Consider if logging these might expose sensitive user data.

Suggestions and Specific Improvements:
• Refactor the class into smaller, cohesive components with single responsibilities (for example, a converter class, a configuration holder class, and a stream utility class). This would help isolate logic and improve testability.
• Un-comment and review the code at line 662 (and similar places) so that the removal of indentations and subsequent processing happens as expected. Ensure that getChildren() is always called or that an alternate mechanism is provided when it fails.
• Introduce stronger JSON payload validation and character encoding checks prior to conversion. If an illegal character is encountered (such as “<d>”), it should be validated and properly rejected with a clear, descriptive error.
• Rework the error handling strategy to use try–with–resources where appropriate. This ensures that streams are closed even in the event of exceptions.
• Review the thread safety of the static factories and any shared state. If necessary, create new factory instances per request or ensure that all shared objects are truly immutable.
• Instead of using InputStream.reset() semantics on consumer streams, consider copying the payload into a byte array (if the payload size is reasonable) and then wrapping it in new input streams whenever needed.
• Consolidate duplicate logic in the methods that derive a JSON payload from different sources. Use a common private method to create the OMElement representation.
• Consider using existing JSON libraries for validation and conversion that already handle edge cases and illegal characters. This might reduce the need for ad hoc error handling.
• Finally, add more descriptive logging and error messaging especially around the conversion steps so that customer issues (like “Illegal character: <d>”) can be more easily traced back to the root cause.

This detailed analysis should help in isolating the root cause of the customer’s reported error and provide clear areas for targeted improvements.
