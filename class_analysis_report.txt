1. The JsonUtil class consolidates a large amount of JSON–XML conversion logic and shows signs of convoluted design.  
2. Multiple factory methods generate similar configuration objects, and the duplicated configuration code impairs maintainability.  
3. The static initialization block eagerly loads properties and creates static factory instances that may not be reentrant if their underlying configuration is modified concurrently, although the configuration objects themselves seem immutable.  
4. The error handling in methods like writeAsJson and getNewJsonPayload is inconsistent. Exceptions are logged and then rethrown as AxisFaults with generic messages; this obscures the underlying cause and may lead to inadequate diagnostics.  
5. In some catch blocks – for example in removeIndentations and in closing streams – exceptions are caught without proper propagation or handling. These catch blocks merely log and sometimes ignore exceptions, potentially concealing resource leaks or stream corruption.  
6. The candidate method removeIndentations (around line 942) is commented out in removeChildrenFromPayloadBody, which suggests that it might have caused errors in processing malformed JSON payloads. This ad hoc workaround is a potential source of instability.  
7. The class relies on marking and resetting InputStreams and wraps them in a ReadOnlyBIS subclass. This design assumes that the incoming streams fully support mark/reset and that the buffer size is sufficient for the entire stream; otherwise, data loss might occur and unpredictable behavior may manifest when illegal characters are encountered (as seen in the customer-reported error with an “Illegal character: <d>”).  
8. Resource management is not handled uniformly. In many methods, output streams and event readers/writers are used without try-with-resources blocks, leaving the risk that streams may not be closed properly in error conditions.  
9. The usage of the IOUtils.copy() and toByteArray() methods from Apache Commons IO is appropriate, but the frequent copying of streams for caching purposes may incur performance overhead and memory footprint issues when processing large payloads.  
10. There is an implicit assumption that payload transformation (removing namespaces and indentations) is always safe. In multi-threaded environments or when processing concurrent requests, mutations to the OMElement without appropriate cloning could lead to thread-safety issues.  
11. The use of raw types or unchecked casts in iterators over OMNode and OMElement collections may lead to ClassCastExceptions at runtime in exceptional circumstances.  
12. The design could benefit from better separation of concerns. The conversion and transformation responsibilities are tightly coupled in one class, making testing and future maintenance harder.  
13. The error message “Could not get parser from data source for element jsonObject” that wraps an XMLStreamException suggests that a JSON payload with embedded illegal XML characters is not properly sanitized. Validating the payload format before conversion and more detailed error logging would be advisable.  

Improvements and Fixes:

1. Refactor the configuration-related code into separate utility or configuration classes. This would simplify JsonUtil and make it easier to test and maintain.  
2. Adopt try-with-resources where possible for streams, readers, and writers. This ensures that resources are closed properly even in error cases.  
3. Improve error handling by preserving the original exception information. Wrap caught exceptions in a custom exception type that includes detailed diagnostics such as the payload snippet or stream position when illegal characters are encountered.  
4. Avoid code duplication by centralizing common patterns (such as checking mark/reset support) into helper methods.  
5. Replace ad hoc workarounds such as the commented-out removeIndentations call with a robust validation step that examines and sanitizes the payload before JSON–XML conversion is attempted.  
6. Enforce generic types for collections (e.g. Iterator<OMNode>) to improve type safety and avoid runtime ClassCastExceptions.  
7. Make the handling logic thread-safe by ensuring that mutable state (such as the caching of InputStreams based on hash codes) is managed with proper synchronization or, ideally, designed to be stateless.  
8. Validate incoming JSON streams before processing. This may involve integrating a JSON schema check or using a more robust parser that can handle invalid characters gracefully.  
9. Modularize the conversion logic so that the responsibilities of reading, writing, and transformation are decoupled. This reduces complexity and can facilitate the reuse of individual components in concurrent environments.  
10. Enhance logging to include contextual information such as message IDs and payload summaries. This would assist in quickly diagnosing issues related to payload formatting and conversion failures in production environments.
